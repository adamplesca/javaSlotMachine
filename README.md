# Simple Java Slot Machine Game

I realized I was getting rusty with Java and wanted to make a project to remove that rust. Always wanted to make a mini slot machine so I did. I also wanted to get better at documentation.

## HOW TO PLAY


## All Versions of the Game through Production
### Version 1 
**Date:** 08/07/2024

Completed the bare bones of the **slot machine**, filled with plenty of logic bugs but had the foundation marked and set to start making it.

### Version 2
**Date:** 09/07/2024

Corrected and fine-tuned more of the game, making the code more streamlined. Some bugs were fixed but still are more to be addressed.

### Version 3
**Date:** 10/07/2024

Fixed minor and major bugs to the game. I could leave this project as is since it is now fully working how I envisioned it. Can make some more quality of life changes which I may do.

#### Bugs Fixed
- Payout calculation: player will be rewarded correctly based on their bet and if they won. *(Major)*
- Player **Bank account** fixed: will correctly take out bets player makes and give back winnings to bank. *(Major)*
- Fixed betting glitch: player can no longer bet more than the slot machine number rolls since this is how the player can win the bets.

### Version 4
**Date** work in progress
