# Simple Java Slot Machine Game

I realized I was getting rusty with Java and wanted to make a project to remove that rust. Always wanted to make a mini slot machine so I did. I also wanted to get better at documentation.

# **HOW TO PLAY**

**Welcome to the Java Slot Machine Game! Here's a quick guide to get you started:**

1. **Enter your starting balance**  

   ![Enter amount to gamble with](https://github.com/adamplesca/javaSlotMachine/assets/116078864/14332d68-bc6b-4f20-b485-18396239e0ce)  
   When you start the game, you'll be prompted to enter the amount of money you want to gamble with. This sets your initial balance.

2. **Place your bet**

   Next, you'll enter the amount you want to bet on a number between 2 and 10. Make sure to keep your bet within this range.

3. **No hit**  

   ![No hit](https://github.com/adamplesca/javaSlotMachine/assets/116078864/3c069a28-d093-48f6-a13f-2dbd10c6c52d)  
   If the number you bet on doesn't match any of the randomly generated numbers, you don't win anything for that round.

4. **1 Hit**

   If your bet matches one of the three randomly generated numbers, you win an amount equal to the bet divided by 2.5, so you don't get completely crazy payouts 

5. **2 Hits**  

   ![2 Hits](https://github.com/adamplesca/javaSlotMachine/assets/116078864/2d041ed7-2129-4fac-b573-62e03ac3b498)  
   If your bet matches two of the three randomly generated numbers, you win an amount equal to your bet multiplied by both of those numbers.

6. **No hits & no more money in balance**  

   ![No hits & no more money in balance](https://github.com/adamplesca/javaSlotMachine/assets/116078864/8cb9bab0-87ff-4d2f-ba4f-d659a362b345)  
   If you run out of money and have no more funds in your balance, the game will prompt you to add more money if you want to continue playing.

7. **User can't play unless more funds are allocated**  

   ![User can't play unless more funds are allocated](https://github.com/adamplesca/javaSlotMachine/assets/116078864/4b3dafc4-1847-43e5-82e6-cea52a352e2a)  
   If you choose not to add more money, the game will end, and you won't be able to place any more bets.


    <h3>Enjoy the game and good luck! ðŸŽ°<h3>
